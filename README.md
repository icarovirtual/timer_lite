Source code for a simplified version of my Android app "Timer".

# Contents
This app showcases the implementation of a simple background countdown timer using the Kotlin programming language instead of Java.

It's possible to set two different delays that repeat sequentially and vibrate the phone in different patterns when each of them is finished. This works even with the screen turned off or while using other apps as each vibration runs as a service (in the foreground) and is trigerred via the system's alarm manager.

The source code is in written and documented in English which is also the app's language.

The original app "Timer" is available in the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.not.sitedoicaro.timer).

# Usage
Clone the repository and build using Android Studio after making sure you have all the dependencies installed in your Android SDK.

# Disclaimer
This repository is not meant to represent the original app's source code and serves only for the purpose of providing sample code for those curious in understading how the fun and interesting features of the app were implemented. Feel free to use it as means of studying or if you need guidance in how to implement certain functionalities.
